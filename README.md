# MPK Calculator

üéâ **My First Python Project!** üéâ

A feature-rich, multi-functional calculator application built with Python and Tkinter. This calculator combines scientific calculations, unit conversions, graphing capabilities, and programmer tools in a single intuitive interface.

This is my first Python project, created to learn GUI development, mathematical operations, and application design!

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Note: `tkinter` comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mpk-calculator.git
cd mpk-calculator
```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

### Scientific Calculator Tab
1. Click number buttons to input values
2. Select an operator (+, -, √ó, √∑, ^)
3. Input the second number
4. Press = to calculate
5. Use DEG/RAD button to switch angle modes for trigonometric functions

### Converter Tab
1. Select a category (Length, Mass, Volume, Temperature)
2. Choose "From" and "To" units
3. Enter the value to convert
4. Result appears automatically
5. Use the Swap button to reverse conversion

### Graphing Tab
1. Enter a mathematical function (e.g., `x**2`, `sin(x)`, `exp(x)`)
2. Set X-axis minimum and maximum values
3. Click "Plot" to visualize the function

### Programmer Tab
1. Select number base (DEC, HEX, OCT, BIN)
2. Input numbers (hex digits A-F available when in HEX mode)
3. Use arithmetic or bitwise operators
4. View 32-bit binary representation in real-time

## Supported Functions in Graphing

- Basic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power)
- Trigonometric: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`
- Exponential/Logarithmic: `exp()`, `log()` (natural log)
- Constants: `pi`
- Numpy functions: prefix with `np.` (e.g., `np.sqrt(x)`)

## Learning Journey

This project was created as my first Python application! Through building this calculator, I learned:

- **GUI Development**: Working with Tkinter to create interactive interfaces
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Organizing code into classes and methods
- **Event Handling**: Responding to button clicks and user inputs
- **Mathematical Libraries**: Using NumPy and Matplotlib for calculations and graphing
- **Error Handling**: Managing exceptions and providing user-friendly error messages
- **Multi-tab Interfaces**: Creating organized, feature-rich applications

As my first project, it taught me the fundamentals of Python programming and gave me the confidence to tackle more complex projects in the future!

## Known Issues

- Temperature conversion requires selecting the Temperature category specifically
- Graph plotting limited to single-variable functions
- Programmer mode uses 32-bit integer representation
